package metrics

// The metrics PSP actually records, declared in one place rather than
// beside their call sites.
//
// Two reasons. First, they are cross-cutting by construction: the poll
// (service/traffic), the push fan-out (service/user, service/sharedclient)
// and the panel round trip (adapters/xui) each hold one piece of the same
// cost model, and a reader trying to reconstruct that model should not
// have to find three packages. Second, declaring them together is what
// keeps the names consistent — this package has no registry-side naming
// enforcement, so the file is the convention.
//
// Naming follows Prometheus convention (unit suffix, _total on counters)
// so a future scrape endpoint is a rendering change, not a renaming one.
//
// Each block below names the Phase 0 question it exists to answer; see
// docs/data-plane-plan.md §2.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// Panel round trips — answers "RTT": the real per-operation latency
// distribution against live panels, replacing the ~300ms figure that has
// been carried in a code comment since v3.5.0-beta.12 without ever being
// measured.
//
// Recorded in the adapter, so the histogram covers the actual HTTP
// exchange (including the adapter's own retry/relogin) regardless of
// which service called it. Labelled by operation name only: panel
// identity would make the label space grow with the deployment.
//
// Only the 3X-UI adapter records these. S-UI has no equivalent hook yet, so
// these histograms describe 3X-UI traffic exclusively — read them that way
// before drawing conclusions about a mixed fleet.

	//   * how many PANELS the user is on. Each panel enforces limitIp on its

	//     multi-panel fleet.
	//   * how many CLIENTS the user needs on ONE panel. clientplan splits by
	//     (password class, flow) because a 3X-UI client row holds a single
	//     password and a single flow, and an SS-2022-128 node cannot share a
	//     row with an SS-2022-256 one. Each split client gets its own email,
	//     and 3X-UI budgets IPs per email — so this multiplier is PSP's, and
	//     it silently multiplies a cap the admin typed once.
	//
	// P alone cannot tell them apart: a user on four panels with one client
