// Package loginguard makes the pre-password decision for the local-login form:
// is this attempt currently locked out, and must it carry a valid captcha?
//
// It reads no settings of its own — the HTTP handler loads the live UISettings
// once per request (cheap, the settings repo is cached) and passes them in, so
// the guard stays a pure function of (settings, scope, failure history) and is
// trivial to test. The actual captcha *answer* check lives in the captcha
// package; this guard only decides whether a challenge is owed.
