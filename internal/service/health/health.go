// Package health probes each enabled node and persists the outcome on the Node
// row so the admin UI / user portal can show a live status dot without hitting
// 3X-UI directly.
//
// The health verdict is pure reachability — "is the proxy port open?" — not a
// 3X-UI control-plane check:
//   - TCP protocols (VLESS/VMess/Trojan/Shadowsocks/AnyTLS/Naive): a TCP connect to
//     ServerAddress:Port. Connect succeeds → up; refused/timeout → down.
//   - UDP-only protocols (Hysteria2/TUIC): a QUIC version-negotiation probe.
//     A reply proves a QUIC server is listening; ICMP port-unreachable proves
//     nothing is; silence is INCONCLUSIVE and is reported as such, never as up.
//     See quicVersionNegotiationProbe for why silence is a real third answer.
//
// v3.5: port / protocol are read directly from the Node row — they're written
// by the inbound write-through paths (CreateInbound / ImportExisting /
// UpdateInboundConfig) and kept aligned by reconcile axis A (see
// docs/inbound-ownership.md). Health no longer calls 3X-UI at all; cutting the
// per-cycle ListInbounds also means a panel-API outage no longer affects the
// data-plane probe. Inbound-existence drift is covered by reconcile §9.4.3 #6.

// WHY THIS RATHER THAN A ONE-BYTE POKE: a connectionless socket gives the
// caller no signal at all unless the peer chooses to answer. The previous
// implementation wrote one 0x00 byte, which no QUIC server will ever reply to,
// and then reported the inevitable timeout as OPEN — so for every Hysteria2 and
// TUIC node the probe could only ever return "up", including when the host was
// gone entirely. Version negotiation is the one QUIC exchange that requires no
// keys, no ALPN and no valid connection ID, so it is the only thing we can ask
// a proxy server that it will answer without credentials.
//
// VERIFIED against a real quic-go server (2026-09-09) — the stack BOTH
// Hysteria2 and TUIC are built on. It answered this exact datagram with 35
// bytes whose version field was 0x00000000, i.e. a genuine Version Negotiation
// packet. So a healthy unobfuscated node reads as ok, not as inconclusive;
// without that check this probe could have reported the whole UDP fleet
// unprobeable and looked principled while doing it.
//
// The three outcomes are all real and all distinct:
//   - a reply            → a QUIC server is listening (open)
//   - ICMP unreachable   → nothing is listening (closed)
//   - silence            → INCONCLUSIVE. A filtered port, a dead host, and a
//     live Hysteria2 with salamander obfuscation enabled (which is *designed*
