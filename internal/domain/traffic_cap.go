// PanelQuotaCap converts PSP's period-relative quota headroom into the
// absolute counter value a panel actually enforces against.
//
// The two sides measure different things, and conflating them is a defect
// PSP shipped for a long time (docs/traffic-floor-defect.md):
//
//   - PSP thinks in PERIODS. TrafficFloorBytes returns "bytes left in the
//     current billing period" — a number that resets every period.
//   - 3X-UI thinks in LIFETIMES. Its depletion sweep is
//     `total > 0 AND up + down >= total`, where up/down accumulate through
//     `SET up = up + ?` and are never reset — PSP keeps its own period
//     baselines and pins the panel's own renewal cycle to never.
//
// Pushing the period number into the lifetime comparison disabled a user at
// half their quota in their first period, and earlier every period after.
// Adding the panel's own counter restores the intent: the panel now cuts the
// client off exactly when it burns `headroom` more bytes FROM NOW.
//
// headroom <= 0 means unlimited and must pass through as 0 — the panel reads
// total == 0 as "no cap", and adding an offset there would invent a quota for
// a user who has none.
//
// One consequence worth stating: TrafficFloorBytes encodes "already at or past
// the limit" as a headroom of 1, which rebases to panelLifetime+1. The panel
// therefore cuts an exhausted client as soon as it moves ANY further traffic,
// rather than while it sits idle at exactly its limit. That is the right shape
// for a net whose job is bounding abuse during a PSP outage — an idle exhausted
// user consumes nothing, and the moment they consume anything they are gone
// within one traffic tick. Special-casing the sentinel to cut an idle user too
// would couple this to another package's encoding to buy a few seconds.
//
// The cap is deliberately generous, and there are THREE reasons it can exceed
// the true remaining quota. The first two are transient and self-correcting;
// the third is structural and is not.
//
//  1. STALENESS. panelLifetime is the last raw cumulative counter PSP read from
//     the panel (LastRawTotalBytes), so it lags by up to one poll interval.
//     Corrected by the next poll.
//
//  2. COUNTER RESET. It goes backwards when the panel-side counter is reset (an
//     xray restart, an admin pressing reset), leaving the stored value above the
//     live one. Also corrected by the next poll.
//
//  3. FAN-OUT ACROSS PANELS — the largest term, and the only permanent one.
//     headroom is the user's GLOBAL remaining bytes, and SyncUserLifecycle
//     sends that same figure to EVERY panel the user holds a client on, each
//     rebased onto that panel's own counter. So a user spread across P panels
//     is permitted `headroom` more bytes on EACH of them: P x headroom in total,
//     not headroom.
//
//     This cannot be fixed here, and probably not at all. The predicate under
//     enforcement is `Σ_panels usage >= limit`: PSP owns the limit, and each
//     panel owns exactly one addend and cannot see the others. No single value
//     pushed to one panel makes that panel enforce a sum it has no access to.
//     Splitting headroom P ways would bound the total but cut off a user who
//     spends it all on one panel — failing on the side this net exists not to
//     fail on.
//
//     It costs nothing in normal operation: PSP's own enforcement (traffic poll
//     -> SetServiceSuspendedAndSync) works off the SUMMED usage and is exact.
//     The amplification applies only while PSP cannot poll, which is precisely
//     the window this cap covers. Stated here because an error budget that
//     enumerates its two smallest terms and omits its largest reads as tighter
//     than it is.
//
// All three err toward letting a user through rather than cutting them off,
// which is the right side to miss on for a safety net whose whole job is to
// bound abuse during a PSP outage.

	// GETS AT MOST 5% LONGER THAN THEY SHOULD HAVE. Their remaining headroom
	// is the time they have left, so a fixed fraction of it is a fixed
	// fraction of that time.
	//
	// Anything much tighter is below the noise floor and buys nothing: the
	// panel's cap is already stale by one poll interval of the user's traffic
	// no matter what this is set to, so a band smaller than that adds no risk
	// and suppresses no writes either.
	quotaBandDivisor = 20
	// maxQuotaBandBytes is an absolute ceiling, and the one place the

	// reading "5%" pictures 500 GB. It binds above 20 GiB of headroom.
	//
	// Unlike the divisor, this number IS one data should set: its whole job
	// is to bound the absolute drift a band may swallow, and how large that
	// has to be is an empirical question. A 40.9-hour production window
	// (25 users, 9 nodes, P=4.0) put the largest sibling drift ever observed
	// at 607 MiB, with p95 at 14.9 MiB. 1 GiB covers the worst observed cycle
	// with room to spare; the 8 GiB this started as was picked before that
	// window existed and left an order of magnitude of unnecessary overshoot
	// on the table.

// PanelQuotaBand is how far a panel's stored cap may lag the intended cap
// before PSP spends a write to correct it.
//
// The band is NOT a tuning knob derived from observed traffic. It is a policy
// number with one meaning: HOW MUCH EXTRA TRAFFIC A USER MAY GET IF PSP STOPS
// RUNNING. PSP itself still cuts a user off at the exact right point on its
// next poll, so a stale panel cap only ever materialises as real overshoot
// during a PSP outage — which is the one scenario the panel-side cap exists
// for. Sizing it from a measured delta distribution would optimise write
// volume and let the safety margin fall out as a by-product; this is the other
// way round, which is the correct one.
//
// Anchoring on the remaining headroom rather than the user's total limit is
// what keeps the band safe as a user approaches exhaustion: the tolerance
// shrinks with what is left to protect, so it can never exceed the headroom
// itself. A limit-anchored band would do the opposite — 1% of a 1 TB quota is
// 10 GB, which for a user with 1 GB left would authorise a tenfold overshoot.
//
// Integer division gives the boundary cases for free: headroom 0 (unlimited)
// and headroom 1 (TrafficFloorBytes' "at or past the limit" sentinel) both
// yield a band of 0, so an unlimited client and an exhausted one are always
// pushed exactly.

//
//   - stored > want — the panel holds a cap that is too GENEROUS. Bounded by
//     the band, only realisable during a PSP outage, and the direction the
//     steady state actually drifts in: a user's quota is shared across their
//     clients, so traffic on client j lowers every OTHER client's intended cap
//     while their own panel counters sit still. This is what the band is for.
//
//   - stored < want — the panel holds a cap that is too STRICT, and would cut
//     a paying user off EARLY. This happens when headroom grows: a new billing
//     period, or an admin raising the quota. Tolerating it would delay someone
//     getting service they are owed, so it is never tolerated — one write, now.
