// PSPClient is the v3.9.0 first-class client record — PSP's mirror of 3X-UI's
// `clients` table (one row, projected by the panel into every inbound it is
// attached to). ONE PSPClient per (UserID, PanelID, CredClass) holds the
// credentials PSP both pushes to 3X-UI and renders into subscriptions (full
// symmetry — no on-the-fly derivation), plus the monotonic traffic counters.
//
// It supersedes the per-(user,node) [XUIClientEntry] ownership model: where the
// old model created N clients (distinct email per node) for a user on a panel,
// PSPClient is ONE client attached to many inbounds via [PSPClientInbound]. The
// two coexist during the v3.9.0 migration window; XUIClientEntry is retired once
// every install has migrated.

	// the same UUID-derived value). A second class (1, 2, …) is minted ONLY when

	// here — no per-inbound summation (which would double-count a shared client).
